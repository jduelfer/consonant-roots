# consonant-roots
Gives a list of unicode vocabulary from our Tigrinya Field Methods research project and extracts all consonant roots from the vocabulary list. This is extremely important for Tigrinya because consonant roots and their significance in word determination are being greatly challenged. Additionally, one could take from this algorithm meaningful phonotactic constraints based upon frequency of correlations.
